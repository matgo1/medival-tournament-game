It simply made cli game made for fun and practize. In this game you play for a chosen class and you need to win 3 times to win princess heart.
## Features
- Made on c++ with many googling but without ai (except cmake file)
- My biggest project in c++ at this moment
## Requirements
- C++11 or heigher
- CMake

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matgo1/medival-tournament-game.git

## Future plans
Maybe I will add some new classes for this game later, but I don't see real demand in it.
